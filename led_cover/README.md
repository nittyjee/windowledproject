### These are the files for the LED cover.
(1) A hollow disk that is used to add height above the LED surface.

(2) A transparent disk.


The transparent disk has been cut from acrylic.

From the top down, the transparent disk is screwed through the hollow disk, then the LED, then the heatsink.

These are SVG files, and were cut using a CNC using Easel Software from Inventables:

You may have to somehow convert them to other formats to have it cut.
It may be best to cut them using a laser cutter.
